# Module 5: Certification Roadmap

This activity is designed to introduce you to the world of information technology certifications.  A certification is a testament to your skills and proficiency in a certain subject area or technology. Holding certifications has been shown to increase a job seeker's marketability to employers as well as result in a higher salary when hired. Certifications can also help you further your professional development. There are a variety of certifications available. Obtaining a certification almost always involves passing an exam.

To explore various certification pathways and general landscape, we will be using a resource developed by CompTIA, a certification body and professional organization. Here's what you need to do: 

1. Go to the [IT Certification Roadmap](https://certification.comptia.org/docs/default-source/downloadablefiles/it-certification-roadmap.pdf). 
2. Review the diagram, making note of CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security+, CEH, and CISSP. These are the certifications that this cybersecurity boot camp was developed around. (This boot camp was influenced by other certifications in this diagram as well.)
