## Module 2: First Weeks' Expectations / Reccomended Prep Activities 

Now that you have all the tools, you'll be able to hit the ground running on the first day of class. You may be curious about what the first few weeks of class will cover and if there is anything you can do to get ready beforehand. 

We will cover a lot of ground at the begining of course. Everything from largre-scale overviews of the cybersecurity domains and job markets to hands-on skills like working in the terminal and coding with python to fundamental concepts like networking and operating systems. Some of that may sound daunting. Maybe you've heard a few of those skills before, but you could use a refresher... Either way, have no fear! You will have plenty of opportunities to learn and practice once class starts. But you can also start right now, with some introductory prep activities listed below. 

#### **SANS Cyber Aces**

[SANS Cyber Aces](http://www.cyberaces.org/) is an online course that teaches the core concepts related to operating systems, networking, and systems administration. The course, developed by SANS, is self-paced through video lectures. The best part, it's **free**!

There are several hours of material available. If you want to check out some of the topics we'll cover in class, then we reccomend prioritizing these three lessons: 

- [Linux—OS Background & Building the Linux VM](https://tutorials.cyberaces.org/tutorials/view/1-1-2)
- [Networking—Introduction and Layer 1](https://tutorials.cyberaces.org/tutorials/view/2-1)
- [Windows—Command Line Basics](https://tutorials.cyberaces.org/tutorials/view/1-2-3)

Note that these courses are designed with the assumption that you have solid IT fundamentals. 

#### **Stanford Computer Science 101**

Don't have any prior technology background? Then we reccomend you check out the [free online  Computer Science 101 courses](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycscs101-sp-computer-science-101) offered by Stanford University's School of Engineering. CS101 aims to provide general background on computers, demystify how they operate, and make them more accessible to a novice audience. 

To enroll in the course, you will need to register for a Stanford Online account as well as agree to Stanford University's academic policies and code of conduct. The course includes exercises and can be completed in about four hours.

#### **Codeacademy: Python Tutorial**

Do you have any experience coding? We will start coding in the first few weeks of course. If you don't have any prior experience or need a refresher, check out [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), particularly the tutorial on [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python). Python is a programming language that is often used due to its versatility and overall user-friendliness. 

The Python tutorial will get you acquainted with coding and set you up for the material coming down the pipeline in this course. Note that you must create a Codeacademy account before you can sign up for one of their courses. 

#### **Recommended Writing**

Newcomers to the cybersecurity field are often surprised by the amount of writing that is required . If you are a good writer or simply enjoy writing, your future employer is going to love you. But if your writing skills could use some work, fear not! There are many helpful resources available, including the video series [Professional Writing Skills](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzLHunnjEdX-YLYtSFgTfVJovtc8I4prp).

We will be doing plenty of writing in this program, including a report that you can later use as a writing sample for employers. You should use Google Docs for writing assignments. 

#### **Safari Books**

Lastly, we recommend [Safari Books](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/) for cybersecurity articles and information. Unlike the previously mentioned resources, Safari Books comes with a price tag of $400 or $39 a month. If it is fiscally reasonable for you, it is well worth the investment. Safari Books is an amazing resource for thousands of technical books and video tutorials, including important Certification Prep texts that we will cover in the next module. 

**Note:** Veterans and current military may be eligible to obtain free access. Contact the learning resource center of your unit or base for more information.

## Module 3: Jobs, Certification and Prep

Another central topic covered in the early stages of this course is the Cybersecurity job market. As you  will learn, it is a vast and layered landscape. We reccomend you familiarize yourself with the types of jobs currently in demand and keep in mind the required skills, experience and certifications that arise in your research. 

### **Explore Indeed.com**

There are many job aggregating websites on the internet. One job board we reccomend using is [Indeed.com](www.indeed.com). The following activity is designed for you to aquaint yourself with the job search process. 

#### Instructions

1. Enter **cyber security** (two words) in the **what** field. Set your location in the **where** field. `Find Jobs` to initiate the search. Note: If you do not live in a metropolitan area, we recommend increasing the search radius in the left menu. 

2. Repeat the search with the following terms in the **what** box: 

- _cybersecurity_ (one word)
- _cyber_
- _IT security_
- _information_ 
- _INFOSEC_
- _information assurance_

3. Once you have a hang of the process, complete the following tasks:

- Find a job post that interests you. Copy and paste the job description into a document and save it to a local folder.
- Identify 10 terms that recur across multiple posts. Research each term, and then define it in your own words (one to three sentences per term). 

#### **Take-Aways:**

- Job titles for security professionals vary from organization to organization. Pay attention to the variety of job titles and adjust your search criteria as necessary so that you don't miss out on job postings.

- You may notice titles like *analyst, engineer, architect,* and *specialist.* We will discuss the hierarchy of these roles in class.

#### **Resources:**

Check out the following infographics and articles to find out who is hiring and what they're looking for in candidates.

### **Certification Roadmaps**

You may have noticed a reoccuring component of many job listings: certifications. 

A certification is a testament to your skills and proficiency in a certain subject area or technology. Holding certifications has been shown to increase a job seeker's marketability to employers as well as result in a higher salary when hired. Certifications can also help you further your professional development. There are a variety of certifications available. Obtaining a certification almost always involves passing an exam.

#### COMPTIA Activity

To explore various certification pathways and general landscape, we will be using a resource developed by CompTIA, a certification body and professional organization. Here's what you need to do: 

1. Go to the [IT Certification Roadmap](https://certification.comptia.org/docs/default-source/downloadablefiles/it-certification-roadmap.pdf). 
2. Review the diagram, making note of CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security+, CEH, and CISSP. These are the certifications that this cybersecurity boot camp was developed around. (This boot camp was influenced by other certifications in this diagram as well.) 

3. Download and save the following files to your computer. These will allow you to explore key certifications in depth to familiarize yourself with the content that lies ahead. They also serve as useful guides for the certification exams. You will notice that these certifications overlap significantly.
   - [Network+](https://certification.comptia.org/docs/default-source/exam-objectives/comptia-network-%28n10-006%29_examobjectives.pdf)
   - [Security+](https://certification.comptia.org/docs/default-source/exam-objectives/comptia-security-sy0-501-exam-objectives.pdf?sfvrsn=2)

# Module 4: Your Expectations and Ours 

For this last module, we want to ensure you are in the right mindset for this course. 

## Getting in the Right Mindset

Your attitude plays a key role in your success in this course. As you embark on the journey ahead, it's essential for you to align your attitude and expectations with reality. Below are our tips for ensuring your success in this program and making this learning experience a rewarding one.

#### 1. Overcome Frustration

This boot camp will be a challenging experience. For many of you, the skills taught in this program are vastly different from what you've been exposed to before, and you may feel discouraged if concepts and skills don't click right away. Have confidence that you will improve, and approach each class as an opportunity to learn something new. Six months from now, you'll marvel at how far you've come. 

#### 2. Take Charge of Your Learning

You will get out of this program what you put into it. That is, in order to succeed, you must take ownership of your learning experience. 

Like any craft, cybersecurity requires diligence, practice and experimentation, and a desire to improve. From Day 1 through Day 180 and beyond, continually remind yourself that *you* are responsible for your success. We will be here to guide, encourage, facilitate, and provide feedback, but it's up to you to put in the effort.

#### 3. Put in the Time

As newcomers to the cybersecurity field, be ready to put in your share of hours in order to master your craft. We've found that the most successful students put in about 20 hours of outside classroom time per week. More challenging topics may require additional hours of study and practice. 

Look at this time as an investment in yourself, and know that for every hour you spend, you are securing yourself a better opportunity after graduation. 

#### 4. Be Patient

You won't become a cybersecurity expert overnight. This is especially important to remember during the first few weeks of class, when you are more likely to feel frustrated. You may not grasp certain concepts immediately, and that's okay. Be patient with the process and with yourself. A topic that confuses you in Week 1 will be second nature by Week 24. Learning a new skill takes time, but rest assured that you *will* learn.

In addition, be patient when it comes to troubleshooting issues you experience along the way. One of the biggest sources of frustration to new students of cybersecurity is the amount of time it can take to debug an issue. Take whatever comfort you can in the fact that this is completely normal and even valuable. The time you spend troubleshooting is a critical part of the learning process. Each bug you investigate is a lesson that adds to your arsenal of knowledge. 

#### 5. Get Your Hands Dirty 

This boot camp requires your active participation. You need to attend class, complete the assignments, and watch tutorials. You also need to spend a considerable amount of time outside of class honing your skills. To succeed in this boot camp, you'll need to do more than read, watch, and follow along. Step away from the sidelines and enter the fray. Work through the problems that stump you and learn from your mistakes. This is the only way to improve and ultimately master these skills.

#### 6. Try Things on Your Own

"Am I doing this right?" is a question that instructors prefer not to hear—not because they are unwilling or unable to help, but because it suggests a lack of confidence on the part of the student. Learn to wipe this question from your mind. Attempt to solve problems on your own, and request assistance from your instructor if you get stuck. Phrase your question like this: "I tried [method A]. It didn't work so I tried [method B], which also didn't work. What should I try now?" Notice the change in tone. Instead of timidly asking for assurance, give yourself permission to try—even if it means failing at first. 

#### 7. Team Up 

In this boot camp you will be asked to collaborate with your classmates to work through assignments and solve problems. Very often, a fresh perspective and another pair of eyes can help you overcome a bug or understand a challenging concept. So, form study groups and work with your peers, and learn from each other in the process.

#### 8. Master the Art of Google-Fu

You may be surprised by the amount of googling you are asked to do in this program. This is done to help you learn the art of Google-fu, the ability to quickly find and apply information on the Internet. 

Cybersecurity doesn't rely on memorization but rather the process of curating bits and pieces of knowledge that have accumulated in various documentation, forums, and websites. It also requires an ability to quickly research solutions to problems you are working on. The field is constantly changing, and new tools are always on the horizon. As you will soon find, Google is an invaluable resource. 

#### 9. Make a Plan

The key to approaching complex issues in cybersecurity is to formulate a plan. Break down the problem in front of you into discrete, bite-sized tasks. Once you have a plan, write it down and refer back to it often. Don't try to bite off everything at once! 

#### 10. Self-Care Is Key

The best learning occurs when you take care of your physical and mental needs. This means getting enough sleep and exercise, as well as following a nutritious diet. It also means taking breaks and finding moments to relax. Energized, enthusiastic students make for a more productive, positive class experience. 

#### 11. Be an Engaged Student

In order to succeed in this program, you need to be invested in the learning process. Collaborate with your classmates and join study groups. Continue to build your skills outside class through online research. Do your own work and submit assignments you are proud of, and if you ever feel you are borrowing too much, reach out to your Student Success Manager for guidance. 

#### 12. You Can Do This!

This last piece of advice is the most important. Remind yourself each day that you _can_ do this. We've seen students from all backgrounds, experiences, and personal situations persevere and succeed in this program.

There will be challenges ahead. During those times, remind yourself of why you entered the program in the first place. Let this be the fuel to keep you going.

You have everything it takes to learn this craft and to gain the opportunities that come with it. Your future self will thank you.
