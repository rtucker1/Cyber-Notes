# _**Cyber Security Units 1-7 Lesson Plans**_

### General Overview
First few units were pretty solid. Contained clear objectives and instructions. Issues arise in later units: trouble following along with powerpoint; tone of lessons become more instructional rather than conversational; Timing issues; phrasing of instruction becomes monotonous("Explain that..." ennui); lessons can be structured in a way that provided clarity of what objectice/topic they are currently covering (see Restructuring Idea). 

## **Unit 1: Intro to Cyber & Unit 2: Terminals**


Overview & Objectives: Strong Emphasis on student's comfort level  / very supportive of students 

* Engaging activites and Conversational Tone 

 * Difficulty Alligning lesson notes with powerpoint slide

 * **Live vs. Dry Walk-thrus** Good concept but terms  aren't recurring in future lessons. 



### _Meeting Notes_:
* Pay attention to: overview, objectives, instructor notes (What students should be aware of; difficulties/roadblocks)
* Teaching Design shifts tone around Unit 5. 
  - Less focused on instructor as audience; need to make lessons more accessible for teachers 
* Slack vs. Files, consistency needed for delivery of activity instructions 
  
   

## **Unit 3: Python**
Re: Python's place in the curriculum? -- Lesson plan mentions that Python isn't a requirement for entry-level cyber jobs, so why are we spending 6 days on it? Obviously its still important so need to make sure to **Emphasize importance of lessons rather than undermine them**

Can save time in class by having students download apps before hand? 

+Today's Goals, good to keep revisiting throughout powerpoint to enforce points objectives and mark progress.

## **Restructuring Idea**
At anypoint in the lesson plan and the powerpoint, students and instructor should know exactly which Learning Objective they are working towards. Class instructions and powerpoint can be divided by  class objective. (Make it clearer which objective the teacher is leading.)

Will also help teachers keep track of powerpoint place. 

## **Unit 4: Continuing Python**
Instructions are slightly different from powerpoint.
Tone at begiing of each Direct Instruction is more informative/less engaging, like it forgets students are in a classroom and assumes instead that students are reading the instructions.  

## **Unit 5: Intro to Crypto**:
Started to notice time stamp issues. So much information and instruction crammed into 10 minute sections:
- Key Terms exercise: 15 minutes to research, define, and provide examples of 17 terms?
- Modern Crypton And Standards insutructions seems longer than 12 minutes 
- Bitwise OP need more than 10 mins
- Block vs. Stream 

Some powerpoint slides have full bolds. Better to bold terms instead of full sentences.

Very lecture heavy, little engagement/activities.

**Suggestion**: Concepts are relatively straigth-forward. Maybe save some time in classroom by having students read up on simpler concepts for homework 
   - P.A.I.N for homework
   -  Homework as preparation for next class instead of review for previous class
   - Guided practice: Why have students read articles, can they read this before class? Is it an engaging activity.

Too much time spent on Caesar Code? Fairly simple concept conisdering how much time is spent on it. 

5.2 Asymmetric + Digital Signatures
Past three units mention that concepts learned are "not pre-requisites for cyber securit industries"
Even if this is true, it might be de-motivating for the students to hear? "Why are we learning this?" Again, **Emphasize importance of lessons rather than undermine them**


**Major Note**
- Noticed that most sentences of each instruction starts with variation of: 
    - "Explain that..."
    - "Point out that..."
    - "Let students know that..."
    - "Remind students that..."
    - "Emphasize that..." 

I understand that using these phrases frames the instruction in a way that makes the instructor-facing rather than the student-facing, but it is pretty distracting once you notice how frequently it is used. Should find a way to optimize the instructions.  

**Data Viz** uses the same phrases, but incorporates it smoothly. "Once students have understood _abc_, explain that _xyz_." 


or instead of monotnous, stagnant:                      

- point out _abc_
- point out _lmno_
- point out _xyz_

Say, "Point out the following:..." or "You should cover the following concepts..." 


## **Unit 6: Wireshark**
Personally, where I was most lost in the weeds. Hard to connect to concepts, esoteric applications & technical aspeccts  but there is a better balance between activities and lecture than in Unit 5. It is more student centric in a good way. 

**Another Timestamp Issue** 
More time needed for OSI model explanation. **10 mins for 20 slides?**
Formatting issue in GH 14, bullet points = **
Lesson 6.3 Powerpoint doesn't check up on Daily Goals. 


## **Unit 7: Network Security**

Still being revised by team. Inconsistencies between lessons and powerpoint but Unit 7 seems simple and functional. 

**7.3 No class instructions.** 




# _**Dataviz Units 2 & 14**_

In general, very clean and engaging. Instructions never forget about the students. Lesson includes images every few bullet points. 

Unit 2 Powerpoints seem inconsisent with GH lesson plans. PP seems focused on the concepts and Lesson plan seems more focused on the activities. Also lacks the Today's Goals checklist  that Cyber has. 

Unit 14: Javascript

+Discusses comparisons and contrast to Python

Lesson plan walks thru slide show. "Use slides 1-7 to explain...", but DV Powerpoints have significantly less then Cyber. 

No Powerpoint for lesson 2?
