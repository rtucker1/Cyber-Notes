### **The Tools:** 

#### 1. Google Chrome

This is the web browser we'll be using to quickly determine whether our code is working. Google Chrome has a number of tools that make it an ideal platform for our purposes, so if you are currently using a different browser, we encourage you to switch to Chrome.

**Installation Instructions**: 

1. If you don’t already have Chrome installed, visit the download page [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html).

While you're at it, you should go ahead and create a Google account, iif you don't have one already, by following these steps. 

1. Go to the [sign-up page](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?) and complete the form. 

2. Review and accept Google's Privacy Policy. 

3. Verify you are logged in by browsing to google.com and looking for a personalized icon in the top right corner, as seen in the image below:

#### 2. Slack 

Slack is an online communication tool that is a mix of forum, instant messenger, and email all rolled into one. It's a tool used by countless organizations worldwide, and you'll be using it every single day for the next six months.

We will use Slack to send code snippets during class, relay important announcements, and facilitate group exercises. You will receive the link to your class-specific channel during orientation.
